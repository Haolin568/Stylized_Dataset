# Stylized Dataset

In order to focus on addressing bias in image datasets, where the background is a common source of bias. For example, classifiers may be induced to rely on background information such as airplanes in the sky, cars on roads, or boats on the water.

By using "style transfer" to create a fake relationship in which the style of the painting correlates with the subject that is to be recognized. the project will intentionally introduce biases into the dataset, providing an opportunity for researchers to develop classifiers that can recognize subjects accurately despite these biases.
